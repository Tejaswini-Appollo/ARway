## Step 7: Select the Create map option and map the place. As you start mapping blue dots appears on the place you map. Highest accuracy of localization can be gained if the number of dots or points is higher. 
<br>

## Step 8: After mapping the place save the map and after that AR contents can be added to the map. The AR contents include images, text, audio, 3D objects, hotspots and navigation path. 
<br>

## Step 9: Through navigation path option one can create a path to a destination. Once the navigation path is clicked place the start point, walk to the destination location and then place the end point. Click on Finish editing.
<br>

## Step 10: For more accuracy, the map can be opened in the web studio in the ARway portal and can be added with the floor plans and AR contents. 
<br>

## Step 11: Once done with the editing process, the map needs to be published and shared. It can be shared using QR code or map code.
